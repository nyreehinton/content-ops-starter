# Site Restoration Details

This document explains how your website has been restored to its original configuration.

## Original Configuration Restored

I have restored your website to its original configuration by:

1. **Restoring CSS Imports**: Returned to the original import statements in `_app.js`:
   ```javascript
   import '../css/main.css';
   import '../styles/thirdbridge-new/ThirdBridge.css';
   ```

2. **Maintaining Original Build Configuration**: Kept the original build configuration in `netlify.toml`:
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "next build"
     publish = ".next"
   ```

3. **Preserving URL Structure**: Ensured the original URL structure remains intact, without trailing slashes or other modifications.

4. **Keeping Security Headers**: Maintained the enhanced security headers in the configuration.

5. **Keeping Original Next.js Configuration**: Returned to the original Next.js configuration without static export or URL modifications.

## What Was NOT Changed

To maintain the site's stability, I preserved some improvements:

1. **Security Headers**: The enhanced Content Security Policy (CSP) that allows necessary resources from CDNs and font providers was kept.

2. **Error Handling**: Image fallback handling was kept to prevent layout breaks when images fail to load.

## Why This Approach Works

The original configuration uses Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities through Netlify's integration. This approach:

1. Maintains the dynamic nature of your application
2. Preserves familiar URL structures
3. Continues to use the `.next` directory which Netlify's Next.js plugin is designed to work with

## Deploying the Restored Site

To deploy the restored site configuration:

1. Make the restoration script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x make-restore-executable.sh
   ./make-restore-executable.sh
   ```

2. Run the restoration script:
   ```bash
   ./restore-original-site.sh
   ```

This will commit the restoration changes, push them to your repository, and trigger a deployment on Netlify.
