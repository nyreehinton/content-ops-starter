    subtitle: Are the readings accurate?
    text: >
      Over the past year, I’ve conducted an in-depth review of Tesla’s odometer
      systems, analyzing everything from patent filings and charging logs to
      user testimonies on social media. My primary goal has been to determine
      whether Tesla vehicles accurately measure mileage or if certain
      algorithmic factors are inflating those readings. In this section, Ill
      walk you through the data sources, investigative steps, and final
      takeaways of my research”along with practical tips for anyone looking to
      understand, validate, or challenge their own Teslas odometer readings.

    text: "Like many Tesla buyers, I was drawn in by the promise of cutting-edge technology, efficiency, and long-term savings. I spent $60,000 on a used 2020 Tesla Model Y, expecting a reliable, high-performance vehicle. Instead, I found myself bringing it in for service at least once every month for the first 6-7 months. On top of that, I spent over $5,000 on tires, watching them wear out at an alarming rate. My preconceived notions about electric vehicles—lower maintenance, long-lasting components, and superior efficiency—were quickly turned upside down.\_\n\nThen I noticed something even stranger: the miles on my odometer were accumulating far too quickly. Given how often the car was either in service or unusable, I suspected something was off. But what really cemented my suspicion was my own driving history—I had previously owned a Chevy Camaro, a Mercedes, and another Camaro, and none of those vehicles had ever felt this *disconnected* from reality in terms of mileage, efficiency, or required maintenance. Something about the Tesla just felt… **off**.\n\nOnce Tesla refused to honor repairs after my warranty expired, I revisited the odometer issue and conducted a simple Google search, which led me to Reddit threads full of Tesla owners experiencing the same discrepancies. That moment sent me down the rabbit hole. **Given my extensive background in capital markets, fundamental equity research, data analytics, and shareholder governance, it was only natural to leverage those skills—not from the usual lens of institutional investing, but from one of consumer protection.** What began as a frustrating ownership experience quickly turned into a large-scale investigation into Tesla’s practices, uncovering something far more deceptive than I ever anticipated.\n"
