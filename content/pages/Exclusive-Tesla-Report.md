    subtitle: A Data-Driven Inquiry into Mileage Metrics
    text: "<div style=\"text-align: left\">Over the past two years, I’ve conducted an in-depth review of Tesla’s odometer systems through analysis of 2,551 Tesla patents, vehicle telematics data from a 2020 Model Y, and comparative studies with legacy automakers. The research demonstrates that Tesla's odometer values represent energy consumption estimates rather than direct distance measurements.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left\">Through this abstract, I’ll walk you through the data sources, investigative steps, and final takeaways of my research, along with my thoughts on implications for the broader electric vehicle industry.</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">## How did we get here?</div>\n\nMy journey into this investigation began not from abstract interest but from direct experience as a Tesla owner, leading to a personal frustration—a nagging suspicion that the odometer in my 2020 Tesla Model Y was accumulating miles faster than I was actually driving. Dismissed by service center technicians (\"within normal variance\") and challenged by the company, I sought a better understanding through available data.\n\nLike many others, I was drawn to the promise of cutting-edge technology and long-term savings, initially choosing Tesla for its reputation for innovation and efficiency. I purchased a used 2020 Model Y, expecting a reliable, high-performance vehicle. Instead, I experienced frequent service visits, rapid tire wear, and, most troublingly, an odometer that seemed disconnected from reality.\_A simple Google search led me to a community of other Tesla owners experiencing similar discrepancies.\n\nBut rather than accepting this discrepancy as an EV oddity, I was driven by curiosity and armed with a background in data analytics. So, I set out to systematically investigate the factors behind these anomalies.\n"
