  I initially became suspicious when I observed sudden surges in my own Tesla
  Model Ys odometer, especially leading up to my warranty's mileage cutoffs.
  After I discovered a noticeable mismatch between my actual driving habits and
  the Teslas recorded mileage, I broadened the investigation, collecting
  examples from other drivers who had similar concerns.

Ive built my career around transforming data into strategic advantage, with roles that span equity research, product management, and cross-functional collaboration. At Bloomberg L.P., I learned the fundamentals of equity analysis in the TMT space, managing a 70-company portfolio and ensuring timely, accurate insights for clients. From there, I moved to Reorg Research, where I leveraged machine learning to detect potential shareholder-activist and M\&A scenarios, championing a Pre-Deal-M\&A Database that tracked hundreds of companies under strategic review.

Subsequently, at Third Bridge Group, I moderated over 125 executive-level discussions on consumer staples and adjacent sectors, deepening my capacity to extract critical insights from industry leaders. And most recently, as an ETF Data Product Manager for a multi-billion-dollar product suite at Capital Group, I orchestrated data ingestion for nine new ETF data sources, implemented governance frameworks across cross-functional teams, and enhanced global transparency into buyer/seller trends. Each chapter of my career has reinforced a core skill: the ability to blend analytics, communication, and product visionâ€”ensuring data and technology consistently drive business impact.

#### Strengthening Data Culture and Governance

Across each role, Ive focused on embedding strong data practices at every stage of the product lifecycle. At Capital Group, for instance, I championed a Data Governance framework that spanned several teams and systems ”BI tools, data lakes, and warehouses”ensuring that ETF analytics aligned with regulatory standards and top-line objectives. Beyond policy creation, I helped introduce a seeding-money tracker that flagged over $170M in unreported transactions, reflecting the tangible impact a data-driven mindset can have on compliance and risk mitigation.

#### Driving Innovation Through Automation and Visualization

Efficiency and insight go hand-in-hand. Whether it was wrangling data with PySpark in Databricks or building hyper-extract automations in Tableau, I continually sought ways to reduce repetitive tasks and deliver real-time, actionable dashboards. This automation-first philosophy wasnâ€™t just about boosting output; it was about opening up time for higher-level analysis, turning daily tasks into strategic opportunities.

#### Global Perspective and Cross-Functional Collaboration

My time at Third Bridge, where I hosted over 125 executive-level forums, underscored the value of clear communication across divergent stakeholder groups”ranging from R\&D experts to senior VPs in finance. Similarly, forging partnerships at Reorg Research to launch a Pre-Deal-M\&A Database required deep collaboration with data scientists, compliance teams, and vendor managers. These experiences taught me how to unify distinct perspectives under a shared product vision, guaranteeing that technical, operational, and strategic concerns received balanced attention.

## Future Ambitions

I see my next move as an opportunity to leverage AI-augmented analytics and advanced data governance to solve complex business challenges. The range of my background”capital markets, machine learning, agile frameworks”positions me to help organizations streamline their data ecosystems, enhance product decisions, and remain nimble in rapidly shifting competitive landscapes. By blending robust technical acumen with a knack for leading cross-functional teams, I aim to continue delivering solutions that both simplify operations and unlock new revenue streams.
