## Ams Well Positioned to Benefit from 3D Sensor Demand
(Bloomberg Intelligence) -- Ams is well positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for 3D technology implemented in Apple devices, as well as benefiting from Android and self-driving cars. Ams's strategic acquisitions have allowed them to outpace rivals in revenue growth, making them a favored semiconductor in optical sensors for quarters to come.

Ams, formally known as austriamicrosystems, designs and manufactures sensor solutions. (08/10/18)

## Financial Review

### Earnings
#### Apple Not As Bad As Thought for Ams' 2Q: Earnings Outlook
Ams' better-than-expected 2Q results and strong 3Q sales outlook reinforce our positive view of the company's competitive positioning with Apple in 3D sensing ahead of the pending iPhone launch. Revenues are up 18% from the same quarter of 2017. Due to the underutilization of production facilities, gross margin came in at 9%, the lowest ever reported.

Ams's Q2 results represent a stable non-Apple core business, which could add a favorable boost to earnings if expanded into 2020. This will come from capitalizing on Android customers and winning significant product designs in the automotive industry. (08/10/18)

**Highlights From Recent Results:**
- Second Quarter Revenues Came in at $252.8 Million, Above Top-End Guidance Range and Up 18% Compared to the Second Quarter Last Year.
- IFRS Reported Gross Margin Was 9% Compared to 35% in Q2 Last Year.
- Group revenues for the first half of 2018 were USD 685.5 million.
- Operating cash flow for the second quarter was USD -72.3 million compared to USD [data unavailable].
- This expected result reflects the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity in Singapore.

### Financial Trends
#### Optical Sensing Growth
Ams has placed a large bet on the growth and adoption of 3D technology. So far, 3D sensing has proved to be a well-timed investment strategy. From 2016, total revenues by segment have shifted from equal to overweight consumer & communications. The consumer & communications segment of total revenues has grown from 51% to almost 73%. We can attribute this 22% increase to large customers such as Apple, who are leading the way in 3D implementation.

To sustain growth in this market, Ams must continue to win product designs from its primary customer. Demand for 3D technology provided an additional EUR 200 million in total revenues for Q4 of 2017. (08/10/18)

#### Margins Are Suffering At The Expense of Growth
Ams's gross margin dropped from 50% in 2016 to 9% in Q2. Ams attributed the drop in gross margin to acquisition-based costs and the consumer side, placing the blame on larger programs and larger customers. Operating margins have also suffered, falling from 33% in Q4 of 2016 to -29%, fueled by higher expenses and a slowdown in seasonality. According to Ams, 30% yearly gross margins are here to stay, which can pose a risk to profitability if they are unable to sustain other parts of the business. (08/10/18)

#### IPhone Ramp-Up Should Play Favorably to Ams's 3Q Earnings
Looking past a weak second quarter relative to Q1, Ams has indicated that the 2H18 ramp-up will produce strong revenue results led by optical sensing products. 3Q 2018 revenues are expected to reach $450 million to $490 million, up 78% to 94% sequentially and 46% to 59% year-on-year. So far, Ams has driven revenue by feeding off Apple's high demand for 3D sensors. Higher revenues are not without risk; margins have plummeted and profitability has lowered sequentially. Going forward, 2H18 revenues should provide a much-needed boost to EPS.

Consensus implies Ams will continue to provide a large share of Apple's 3D sensing needs through 2020, which will fluctuate as more suppliers enter the market. (08/10/18)

## Key Research

### Smartphone Opportunity
#### iOS Demand
Ams continues to see optical sensing as its highest volume opportunity through 2020. According to IHS, global shipments of 3D facial sensors are expected to reach 370 million units by 2021, up from 32 million units in 2017. The demand for 3D sensing is bolstered by its use in handset markets, most notably iPhones. (08/10/18)

#### Meeting Expectations Should Be A Breeze
Through 2021, consensus implies Ams will continue to supply $7.5 per device worth of content for Apple to implement front-facing 3D sensing. If Ams can hold onto market share at the current ASP, they should be well on their way to beating revenue expectations for the next three years. (08/10/18)

#### Winning Apple's Good Grace Could Make Things Interesting
If Apple were to introduce just 30% of iPads with Face ID for FY20, it could provide an additional $90 million in revenues for Ams. As with fingerprint authentication, Apple introduced this technology with the latest iPhone and then applied it to all next-generation devices, including iPads. (08/10/18)

### Hardware
#### VCSELs Primed for Boom
VCSELs (vertical-cavity-surface-emitting-lasers) are a key component for 3D sensing, helping push light through the dot projector. A key edge that VCSELs have over other lasers is that they can be tested at several phases throughout the production process, allowing suppliers to check for quality or production issues. EELs cannot be tested until the end of their production cycle. (08/10/18)

#### Enough to Go Around
VCSELs are estimated to cost $6-7 per phone. Lumentum is the current supplier of VCSELs for Apple; however, Finisar was recently awarded US $390 million as a prepayment for future orders. The recent purchase of Princeton Optronics, a developer of VCSELs, could open the door for Ams to capture market share. Other VCSEL suppliers such as Philips Photonics & Finisar are coping with technological challenges that allow successful integration into smartphones. Princeton Optronics differentiates itself by having developed fully optimized VCSELs for over 10 years, formally funded by the US military.

If Ams can capture 20% of the VCSEL market share from Apple, it would translate to an additional $110 million in revenues for FY20. (08/10/18)

#### The Androids Are Coming
Although Apple has had a two-year head start, Android providers are participating in the growing trend of 3D implementation. Ams announced an impressive win for its VCSEL array business, supplying 3D technology for Xiaomi's new Mi8 smartphone, solidifying itself as the first Android platform to implement user facial recognition. Xiaomi's Mi8 sold out within a minute of its release, which could imply more orders from Ams for VCSELs, potentially not yet priced in. With 10% market share, Xiaomi is the fourth-largest smartphone maker in China. (08/10/18)

#### Using FY20 as an Inflection Point
Providing 20% of VCSELs to Apple, 30% of iPad content, and 10% of Android market share would translate to a total revenue number of $2.85 billion for FY20. A 6% upside may not sound exciting, but this doesn’t include the added benefit that may come from the automotive industry, which Ams forecasts to grow 49% through 2020. (08/10/18)

### Automotive
#### The Hype of Self-Driving Cars
Ams is looking to shift business revenues by segment to 60% consumer & 40% non-consumer, which will largely depend on the growth of non-smartphone revenue. According to IHS, the market for automotive LIDAR systems will grow from $290 million in 2016 to $2.7 billion by 2026. (08/10/18)

#### Can Automotive Demand Meet Expectations?
Ams expects a large part of its future revenue to come from the growth of other segments such as automotive, but so far, these expectations have yet to materialize. With a forecast of 49% through 2020, Ams plans to supply the LIDAR technology used in autonomous vehicles and claims they are seeing growing interest from industry leaders. The autonomous vehicle industry faces significant headwinds such as regulatory footing, technical challenges, and timing of implementation. (08/10/18)

## Competitive Strategy
#### 3 For 3
Over the past 3 years, Ams has made a number of strategic acquisitions such as Heptagon, KeyLemon, and Princeton Optronics to remain competitive in the optical sensing space. Heptagon carried a price tag of about $850 million, while Princeton Optronics was acquired for $75 million. Heptagon, a high-end supplier of optical packaging, and Princeton Optronics, a developer of high-performance VCSELs, have turned out to be critical investments. (08/10/18)

#### Smooth Transition
Both acquisitions allow Ams to provide end-to-end solutions in accelerating segments such as 3D sensing and spectral sensing. Although Heptagon was accretive, underutilization of its facilities has placed a drag on margins. Ams has also distinguished itself with the recent purchase of KeyLemon, which focuses on developing biometric software for facial recognition. It’s yet to be seen how this acquisition will affect the bottom line, but, given Ams's track record, they have proven the ability to successfully integrate multiple businesses. (08/10/18)

#### M&A Strategy
Ams, Lumentum, and Finisar are all expanding capacity, which could imply a large ramp-up of shipments in the 2H of 2018. Ams has shown its competitive advantage by tripling its market cap within a year to almost $6 billion, thanks to various acquisitions driving revenue growth. Lumentum has solidified itself as a key supplier of 3D technology, with revenues jumping 66% in the second quarter of 2017 year-on-year, driven by strong demand from Apple. A $390 million investment into Finisar for VCSELs also shows just how far Apple is willing to go to dominate the 3D supply chain. (08/10/18)

## Valuation
#### Is This Premium Really A Discount?
Cumulatively, if Ams is able to supply VCSELs for Apple devices, capture Android market share, and grow their core business by at least 10%, the market could be under-pricing Ams by $1.6 billion over the next 4 years. (08/10/18)

#### P/E
Historically, Ams has traded around 30x and sometimes as high as 80x. If we apply just a 12.5x P/E on a forecasted EPS of $8.20, Ams should be trading at $102.44 for FY20. A 30% increase in share price may be worth keeping an eye on. At a time when Apple suppliers are dropping in valuation, Ams continues to demand a steep premium. (08/10/18)
