# Patent US8054038B2: The Odometer is an *Estimation*, and Nothing More

Tesla’s system for calculating the distance already traveled is heavily reliant on predictive algorithms and sensor data, which do not follow traditional odometer mechanisms. Tesla vehicles use a combination of GPS data, wheel speed sensors, and historical usage patterns to calculate mileage.

According to Patent US8054038B2, the vehicle’s charging controller calculates the total travel distance based on the user’s inputted travel plan. The system inputs location and travel details into the charging system, which subsequently computes the battery’s energy requirements to meet these travel needs. The patent states:

> “converting the total travel miles to a second quantity of electrical energy using a miles-to-electrical energy conversion factor, wherein said miles-to-electrical energy conversion factor varies based on road and traffic condition information”


This indicates that Tesla’s calculation of traveled distance is influenced by conditions that modify the baseline energy efficiency model.
