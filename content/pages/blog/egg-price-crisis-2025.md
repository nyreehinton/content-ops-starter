# The Egg Price Crisis of 2025: Bird Flu or Business as Usual?

## A Deep Dive into the Industry's Mechanics

## Introduction: A Crisis in the Carton

In 2025, egg prices have cracked new records, with a dozen Grade A large eggs averaging $4.95 in January‚Äîa staggering 53% jump from the previous year. Shelves are thinning, stores like Trader Joe's and Costco are imposing purchase limits, and consumers are venting their frustration online. As I write this on March 10, 2025, the headlines scream about bird flu, with over 148 million hens culled since 2022, including 20 million in the last quarter of 2024 alone. It's a dramatic narrative, and it's easy to pin the blame on this outbreak. But is it the whole story?

I'm Nyree Hinton, an analyst and content creator with years of experience unpacking complex industry dynamics through investor conversations. On May 13, 2021, I sat down with Tim Dawson, the former CFO of Cal-Maine Foods‚Äîthe world's largest egg producer‚Äîfor an in-depth interview about the egg industry's inner workings. That conversation, paired with my ongoing analysis of agricultural markets, gives me a unique lens to dissect today's crisis. The question I'm exploring here isn't just whether bird flu is driving these sky-high prices‚Äîit's how structural factors, from feed costs to distribution models, have long set the stage for volatility, with or without a viral outbreak. Let's crack into it.

## Revisiting 2021: Tim Dawson's Window into the Egg Industry

When I spoke with Tim Dawson in 2021, he painted a vivid picture of an industry that's both sprawling and surprisingly personal. "The egg industry still, today, is largely composed of family businesses," he told me, noting that Cal-Maine stands out as the exception‚Äîa public giant in a sea of private, often generational operations. These family-run farms, many tracing back to a great-grandmother's backyard flock, contrast sharply with Cal-Maine's 44 million hens and its status as the top player not just in the U.S., but globally.

### Key Industry Fundamentals

Dawson highlighted a few fundamentals that remain critical today:

1. **Feed Costs Dominate**:

   - Between 50-65% of production cost is feed cost
   - "For every USD 0.25 increase in the cost of a bushel of corn, it impacts their feed cost by a penny per dozen."

2. **Price Volatility**:

   - Prices can swing dramatically (38% in eight days)
   - Seasonal patterns affect pricing (Easter, winter holidays, summer slumps)

3. **Retail Strategy**:

   - Cal-Maine's 90% retail focus proves strategic
   - Sales primarily to grocery giants like Walmart, Publix, and H-E-B
   - Retail provides stability compared to foodservice

4. **Industry Consolidation**:
   - Family businesses transitioning to larger operations
   - Cal-Maine's acquisition strategy of struggling operations
   - Consolidation trend thriving in times of upheaval

## The 2025 Crisis: Bird Flu Meets a Fragile System

<div class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
### Current Market Statistics
- 148 million birds culled since 2022
- 20 million hens lost in Q4 2024
- Prices reaching $7.42 to $7.84 per dozen
- Cal-Maine's 1.6 million hen loss in Texas
</div>

Fast forward to today, and the egg industry is reeling. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has decimated flocks, with the USDA reporting over 148 million birds culled since 2022. Cal-Maine itself culled 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets at its Texas facility in April 2024 alone‚Äî3.6% of its flock gone in one swoop. The result? Supply shortages that have pushed prices to unprecedented heights.

### Market Response and Consumer Impact

- USDA's March 2-8, 2025, Egg Market News Report shows national caged extra-large egg prices at $7.42 to $7.84 per dozen
- Consumers expressing frustration on social media ("Eggs at $10 a carton? I'm done")
- Stores implementing rationing measures
- Political tensions rising over response strategies

## Bird Flu vs. Structural Stressors: My Take

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-8">
  <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Bird Flu Impact</h3>
    - Supply gut punch
    - Over 1/3 of U.S. laying hens lost
    - Immediate price effects
    - Industry-wide disruption
  </div>
  
  <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Structural Factors</h3>
    - Feed cost inflation
    - Distribution challenges
    - Industry consolidation
    - Regulatory pressures
  </div>

### Detailed Analysis of Contributing Factors

1. **Feed Costs and Inflation**
   - 2021: Corn at $7/bushel, soybean meal at $400/ton
   - Feed costs remain 50-65% of production expenses
   - Cal-Maine's efficiency advantage in feed management
2. **Distribution Model Impact**

   - Cal-Maine's 90% retail focus providing stability
   - Smaller farms struggling with volatile markets
   - Retail demand holding despite price increases

3. **Consolidation Effects**

   - Financial strain accelerating industry consolidation
   - Cal-Maine positioned for strategic acquisitions
   - Long-term supply stabilization vs. short-term price volatility

4. **Regulatory Environment**
   - Cage-free mandates increasing capital requirements
   - 26% cage-free in 2021, targeting 70% by 2025
   - Additional cost pressures from compliance

## üîÆ Looking Forward

<div class="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
The egg price crisis of 2025 represents a pivotal moment for the industry, requiring adaptation and innovation from all stakeholders. Success will depend on the ability to implement sustainable solutions while maintaining market stability.

<div class="mt-4 font-bold">
Key Takeaways:
- Industry-wide transformation is essential
- Technology adoption will drive efficiency
- Sustainability remains a critical focus
- Consumer behavior adaptation is crucial
</div>

As we continue to monitor this situation, the industry's resilience and adaptability will be key to overcoming these challenges. Looking ahead, solutions like poultry vaccines (debated due to trade risks) or better feed hedging could help. The USDA's $1.25 billion biosecurity push since 2022 is a start, but controlling HPAI remains elusive. Cal-Maine's expansion into cage-free and branded eggs might steady its course, while consumers may adapt‚Äîcutting back or hunting alternatives. For now, prices may climb until the virus ebbs or supply rebuilds.

As someone who's tracked this sector through countless investor dialogues, I'll keep watching the USDA's Egg Market News and X's pulse for updates. My talk with Dawson gave me a front-row seat to the egg industry's mechanics, and blending that with 2025's data reinforces one truth: this crisis is a perfect storm, not a single squawk. Stay tuned‚Äîand maybe stock up on those cartons while you can.
