## A Crisis in the Carton

In 2025, egg prices have cracked new records, with a dozen Grade A large eggs averaging $4.95 in January—a staggering 53% jump from the previous year. Shelves are thinning, stores like Trader Joe's and Costco are imposing purchase limits, and consumers are venting their frustration online. As I write this on March 10, 2025, the headlines scream about bird flu, with over 148 million hens culled since 2022, including 20 million in the last quarter of 2024 alone. It's a dramatic narrative, and it's easy to pin the blame on this outbreak. But is it the whole story?

I'm Nyree Hinton, an analyst and content creator with years of experience unpacking complex industry dynamics through investor conversations. On May 13, 2021, I sat down with Tim Dawson, the former CFO of Cal-Maine Foods—the world's largest egg producer—for an in-depth interview about the egg industry's inner workings. That conversation, paired with my ongoing analysis of agricultural markets, gives me a unique lens to dissect today's crisis. The question I'm exploring here isn't just whether bird flu is driving these sky-high prices—it's how structural factors, from feed costs to distribution models, have long set the stage for volatility, with or without a viral outbreak. Let's crack into it.

## Revisiting 2021: Tim Dawson's Window into the Egg Industry

When I spoke with Tim Dawson in 2021, he painted a vivid picture of an industry that's both sprawling and surprisingly personal. "The egg industry still, today, is largely composed of family businesses," he told me, noting that Cal-Maine stands out as the exception—a public giant in a sea of private, often generational operations. These family-run farms, many tracing back to a great-grandmother's backyard flock, contrast sharply with Cal-Maine's 44 million hens and its status as the top player not just in the U.S., but globally.

### The Industry's Core Dynamics

Dawson highlighted a few fundamentals that remain critical today. First, feed costs dominate production economics. "Between 50-65% of that cost is feed cost," he explained, adding, "For every USD 0.25 increase in the cost of a bushel of corn, it impacts their feed cost by a penny per dozen." That's a tight margin game, and it's one every producer plays.

Second, egg pricing is a rollercoaster. "Egg pricing is not only seasonal. It's cyclical. It's just extremely volatile," he said, recalling a moment when prices swung 38% in eight days. He tied this to predictable patterns—strong demand around Easter and the winter holidays, slumps in summer—but underscored that sudden shifts are par for the course.

### Cal-Maine's Strategic Position

Cal-Maine's strategy has been described with confidence by industry insiders. Unlike smaller producers, Cal-Maine leans heavily on retail—90% of its sales go to grocery giants like Walmart, Publix, and H-E-B. When asked if this made them over-exposed, former CFO Tim Dawson pushed back: "I don't think it's not taking advantage so much as they believe that's a better business to be in, and that's why they're in that business." He contrasted this with foodservice, where demand for egg products (think liquid eggs for fast food) can crater during disruptions like the 2020 pandemic. Retail, he argued, offers stability—a point that resonates now as we navigate 2025's chaos.

Dawson also flagged Cal-Maine's acquisition playbook. "When those families get ready to make a change, Cal-Maine is there," he said, describing how the company has grown by snapping up struggling or transitioning family operations. This consolidation trend, he suggested, thrives in times of upheaval—a dynamic that continues to play out in 2025's market.

## The 2025 Crisis: Bird Flu Meets a Fragile System

The egg industry is reeling in 2025. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has decimated flocks, with the USDA reporting over 148 million birds culled since 2022. Cal-Maine itself culled 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets at its Texas facility in April 2024 alone—3.6% of its flock gone in one swoop. The result? Supply shortages that have pushed prices to unprecedented heights. The USDA's March 2-8, 2025, Egg Market News Report pegs national caged extra-large egg prices at $7.42 to $7.84 per dozen, with little relief in sight. Experts like David Anderson from Texas A&M warn that as long as the virus persists, "supply will remain tight, potentially pushing prices higher."

### Consumer Impact and Political Response

Consumers are feeling the pinch. Social media posts brim with frustration—"Eggs at $10 a carton? I'm done"—while stores ration stock. Politically, it's a hot potato: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has pointed fingers at past administrations, though culling is a standard HPAI response, not a policy quirk. The scale of this outbreak dwarfs 2015's, when prices hit notable but lower peaks.

But let's not oversimplify. Dawson's 2021 insights remind us that volatility isn't new—it's baked into the egg market's DNA. The question is: how much of this crisis is bird flu, and how much is the industry's underlying structure amplifying the shock?

## The Feed Cost Factor

Feed costs dominate the egg industry's economics. In 2021, Tim Dawson noted corn at $7 a bushel and soybean meal at $400 a ton were "historically pretty high." Today, inflation has kept those pressures alive, and with feed making up 50-65% of production costs, every quarter-dollar hike in corn prices adds a penny per dozen. That might sound small, but scale it across millions of eggs, and it's a margin squeeze—especially for smaller producers without Cal-Maine's efficiency edge.

Dawson hinted at Cal-Maine's resilience: "Cal-Maine works... on minimising the amount of feed that each hen consumes to produce an egg." In 2025, that discipline could be a lifeline as feed inflation compounds bird flu's toll.

## Bird Flu vs. Structural Stressors: A Balanced View

Bird flu is a glaring catalyst—but not the sole villain in the 2025 egg price crisis. The culling of 148 million hens since 2022 is a supply gut punch, no doubt. When you lose that many birds—over a third of the U.S.'s roughly 325 million laying hens—you're going to see prices soar. Cal-Maine's Texas losses alone underscore how even the biggest players aren't immune. Yet, industry warnings about feed costs, distribution quirks, and industry fragmentation suggest there's more at play in this crisis.

Distribution models matter too. Cal-Maine's retail focus—90% of sales—proved prescient during COVID, when foodservice tanked. Now, with steady consumer demand holding despite $5+ cartons, that strategy buffers losses. Smaller family farms, often more tied to volatile foodservice or local markets, lack that cushion. As Dawson told me, "They believe that's a better business to be in." The 2025 data backs him up: retail egg demand isn't buckling, even as prices climb.

Then there's consolidation. The bird flu's financial strain—culling costs, lost production—hits family-owned operations hardest. Dawson's observation that "when those families get ready to make a change, Cal-Maine is there" feels prophetic. In 2025, struggling producers might sell out, accelerating Cal-Maine's dominance. This could stabilize supply long-term but amplify price swings short-term, as fewer players control more hens.

And don't forget legislation. Dawson flagged cage-free mandates—pushed by groups like the Humane Society—as a looming capital burden. By 2021, 26% of U.S. hens were cage-free; commitments suggested 70% by 2025. That shift requires big upfront costs—costs smaller farms can't always shoulder. Bird flu's culls might delay conversions, but the trend persists, nudging production expenses higher and adding another layer to price hikes.

## Conclusion: A Perfect Storm, Not a Lone Culprit

So, is bird flu the main reason egg prices are skyrocketing in 2025? It's a major aggravator—148 million culled hens can't be ignored—but it's not the whole story. Feed cost inflation, retail vs. foodservice dynamics, consolidation pressures, and cage-free shifts have long made this industry a tinderbox. Bird flu lit the match, but the fuel was already there. As I reflect on my 2021 chat with Tim Dawson, I'm struck by how his insights—feed as the cost king, volatility as a constant, Cal-Maine's retail bet—frame today's chaos as both unique and eerily familiar.

### Looking Forward

Looking ahead, solutions like poultry vaccines (debated due to trade risks) or better feed hedging could help. The USDA's $1.25 billion biosecurity push since 2022 is a start, but controlling HPAI remains elusive. Cal-Maine's expansion into cage-free and branded eggs might steady its course, while consumers may adapt—cutting back or hunting alternatives. For now, prices may climb until the virus ebbs or supply rebuilds.

The egg industry is at a critical inflection point. While the current price volatility is expected to stabilize by late 2025, structural changes are becoming permanent. The transition to cage-free production will continue, with an estimated 70% of production expected to meet cage-free standards by 2030. This shift, coupled with ongoing industry consolidation, will likely result in a more segmented market with premium and value tiers becoming increasingly distinct.

Regulatory fragmentation across states will become a defining feature of the industry landscape, requiring producers to maintain multiple production systems and supply chains. This complexity will favor larger producers with the capital to invest in diverse facilities and robust biosecurity measures, potentially accelerating the consolidation trend.

As someone who's tracked this sector through countless investor dialogues, I'll keep watching the USDA's Egg Market News and social media's pulse for updates. My talk with Dawson gave me a front-row seat to the egg industry's mechanics, and blending that with 2025's data reinforces one truth: this crisis is a perfect storm, not a single squawk. Stay tuned—and maybe stock up on those cartons while you can.
