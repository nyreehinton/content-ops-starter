        subtitle: Data Product Manager
        text: >
          At Capital Group, my work focused on developing and managing the
          analytics infrastructure required to support ETF operations,
          reporting, wholesaler compensation, and compliance. This involved
          engagement with cross-disciplinary teams, including IT, compliance,
          product management, and sales, with a strategic focus on data
          governance.


          The $31B ETF ecosystem at Capital Group posed unique challenges due to
          the absence of a transfer agent, requiring us to build a custom
          solution that integrated fragmented data from third-party vendors such
          as Broadridge.

          practices, and the use of tools like Databricks and Tableau.
