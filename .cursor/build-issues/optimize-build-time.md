# How to Optimize Netlify Build Time

## Understanding Build Time Constraints

### Netlify Build Limits

- Free and Pro plans: 300 build minutes per month
- Business plans: 1000 build minutes per month
- Enterprise plans: Custom allocation
- Builds are limited to 15 minutes maximum duration

### Impact of Build Times

- Slower feedback loop for developers
- Delay in seeing changes live
- Potential for timeout failures on complex builds
- Consumption of monthly build minutes quota

## Analyzing Your Build Process

### Identifying Bottlenecks

- Review build logs to see which steps take the longest
- Look for repetitive or redundant operations
- Identify asset processing that could be optimized
- Check for unnecessary build steps

### Measuring Build Duration

- Note timestamps in build logs
- Add timing information to build scripts
- Use the Netlify UI to track historical build times
- Consider implementing custom benchmarking

## Optimization Strategies

### Caching

#### Netlify Cache Directory

- Use the `/opt/build/cache/` directory for persistent caching
- Cache dependencies, build artifacts, or processed assets
- Example for Node.js projects:

```bash
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NPM_FLAGS = "--prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund"
```

#### Dependency Caching

- Use lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock) for faster installs
- Implement package manager caching strategies
- For Yarn: `yarn install --frozen-lockfile --cache-folder /opt/build/cache/yarn`
- For npm: `npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit`

#### Build Caching

- Cache intermediate build artifacts
- Use tools that support incremental builds
- Implement custom caching for expensive operations

### Optimizing Dependencies

#### Reducing Package Size

- Audit and remove unnecessary dependencies
- Use lightweight alternatives where possible
- Consider micro-frontends or modular approaches
- Implement tree-shaking and code splitting

#### Efficient Installation

- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for faster, reliable installs
- Consider `yarn` for potentially faster package resolution
- Use package manager flags to skip unnecessary steps
  - `--no-audit`
  - `--no-fund`
  - `--prefer-offline`

### Build Process Improvements

#### Parallel Processing

- Run independent tasks in parallel
- Use build tools that support parallel processing
- Split large operations into concurrent tasks
- Example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm-run-all --parallel build:*",
    "build:app": "react-scripts build",
    "build:api": "netlify-lambda build src/lambda"
  }
}
```

#### Incremental Builds

- Use tools that support incremental builds
- Only rebuild what has changed
- Implement content hashing for cache invalidation
- Consider static site generators with incremental capabilities
  - Gatsby incremental builds
  - Next.js incremental static regeneration
  - Hugo with proper caching

#### Asset Optimization

- Optimize images before build process
- Use efficient asset processing
- Consider external services for image processing
- Implement proper code splitting and bundling

### Netlify-Specific Optimizations

#### Deploy Contexts

- Use different build commands for different contexts
- Simplify preview builds compared to production
- Example:

```toml
# netlify.toml
[context.production]
  command = "npm run build:full"

[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "npm run build:minimal"
```

#### Build Plugins

- Use Netlify Build Plugins to optimize the build process
- Consider plugins like:
  - Netlify Plugin Gatsby Cache
  - Netlify Plugin Next.js Cache
  - Netlify Plugin Inline Critical CSS
  - Custom plugins for specific optimizations

#### Skipping Builds

- Use `[skip ci]` or `[skip netlify]` in commit messages for minor changes
- Implement smart build detection based on changed files
- Consider manual deploys for certain types of changes

## Advanced Techniques

### Build Matrix Optimization

- Split monolithic builds into separate deployments
- Use Netlify's branch-based or deploy-context configurations
- Consider microsite or micro-frontend architectures

### Pre-Build Processing

- Move expensive operations outside the Netlify build process
- Use CI/CD pipelines for preprocessing
- Consider GitHub Actions for preparation steps
- Push pre-built artifacts to your repository

### Scheduled Builds

- Implement scheduled builds for content updates
- Use external services to trigger builds at optimal times
- Batch content changes instead of triggering individual builds

### Code-Level Optimizations

- Optimize JavaScript and CSS for faster processing
- Implement efficient bundling and tree shaking
- Use performance-focused libraries and frameworks
- Consider server-side rendering vs. static generation

## Measuring Impact

### Build Metrics

- Compare build times before and after optimizations
- Track build phases to identify remaining bottlenecks
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) when possible
- Use Netlify's analytics to track build performance

### Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review build logs for new opportunities
- Stay updated on Netlify features and best practices
- Test new optimization techniques in isolation
- Document effective strategies for your project
