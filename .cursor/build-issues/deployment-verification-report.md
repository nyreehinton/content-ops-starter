4. **Build Configuration**:
   - Optimized netlify.toml with proper redirects and headers
   - Updated build command to include necessary environment variables
   - Added cache headers for static assets

## Deployment Verification Steps

To fully verify these changes, the following steps need to be completed:

1. Build the project locally using:

   ```
   NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Netlify using the fix-deployment script:

   ```
   npm run fix-deployment
   ```

3. Verify deployment using the verification script:
   ```
   npm run verify-deployment -- nyreehinton
   ```

## Manual Verification Checklist

If the automated checks are not working, perform these manual checks:

1. Visit https://nyreehinton.com and verify:

   - Homepage shows proper content with headings
   - No "Content not found" errors are displayed
   - Images and assets load correctly

2. Check browser developer console for:

   - No 404 errors for static assets
   - No JavaScript errors related to content loading

3. Verify Netlify deployment status in the Netlify dashboard

## Troubleshooting Guide

If issues persist after deployment, follow these steps:

1. Check the Netlify deployment logs for build errors
2. Verify that the index.md file has proper frontmatter and content
3. Check that the CustomHTMLLayout component is correctly rendering content
4. Confirm that next.config.js has the proper configuration for asset loading
5. Run the diagnostic scripts again to pinpoint specific issues

## Conclusion

The site requires a fresh deployment to apply all the fixes we've made. Based on our analysis, the main issues are related to asset prefix configuration and content loading. These have been addressed in our fixes, but deployment verification is needed to confirm that all issues are resolved.

For production use, it's recommended to set up the NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable to enable complete deployment verification.
