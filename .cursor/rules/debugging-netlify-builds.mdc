# Debugging Netlify Site Builds

## Common Build Issues

### Non-Zero Exit Codes
- Build processes that exit with a non-zero code will cause deployments to fail
- Look for error messages in the build logs
- Common causes include syntax errors, missing dependencies, or configuration issues

### Build Timeouts
- Netlify build processes are limited to 15 minutes
- If your build exceeds this limit, it will be terminated
- Optimize your build process or consider breaking it into smaller parts

### Memory Limitations
- Netlify build containers have 3GB of RAM
- Memory-intensive operations can cause out-of-memory errors
- Monitor memory usage and optimize where possible

### Hung or Stuck Builds
- Builds that appear successful but don't complete might have lingering processes
- Background processes that don't exit can cause this
- Use `ps auxw` to identify these processes and ensure proper termination

### Dependency Issues
- Missing or incompatible dependencies are a common source of build errors
- Ensure all dependencies are properly specified in your package.json
- Consider using lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock) for consistent installs

### Missing Environment Variables
- Builds may fail if they rely on environment variables that aren't set
- Check your build logs for references to undefined variables
- Set required variables in the Netlify UI or netlify.toml file

## Debugging Strategies

### Reading Build Logs
- Carefully examine the build logs for error messages
- Look for the first occurrence of an error, as subsequent errors may be consequences
- Pay attention to warnings as they might indicate underlying issues

### Local Replication
- Try to replicate the build process locally to debug issues
- Use the same build command specified in your Netlify configuration
- Consider using Netlify CLI to perform local builds with a similar environment

### Isolating the Problem
- Comment out or temporarily remove parts of your build process
- Add debugging output to identify where the build fails
- Use incremental approaches to narrow down the source of the issue

### Environment Differences
- Be aware of differences between local and Netlify environments
- Case sensitivity can be an issue (local development on macOS vs. Linux in Netlify)
- File permissions and path differences can also cause problems

## Fixing Common Issues

### Lingering Processes
- Add explicit termination commands for background processes
- Use `ps auxw` in your build script to identify processes that don't terminate
- Add a cleanup phase to your build process

### Build Timeouts
- Optimize your build process to reduce build time
- Consider using build caching strategies
- Split large builds into smaller components
- Precompile assets when possible

### Dependency Conflicts
- Use lockfiles to ensure consistent dependency versions
- Consider using Netlify's caching for faster installs
- Regularly update dependencies to avoid deprecated packages

### Environment Variables
- Double-check all required environment variables are set
- Use default values for non-critical variables
- Test locally with the same environment variables
