# React Native rules

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow a consistent folder structure (components, screens, navigation, services, hooks, utils)
- Use React Navigation for screen navigation
- Use StyleSheet for styling instead of inline styles
- Use FlatList for rendering lists instead of map + ScrollView
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Optimize images and assets for mobile performance
