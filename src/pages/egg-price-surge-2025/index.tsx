                Our analysis projects a 15% increase in egg prices during Q1 2025, primarily driven by the implementation of California's Proposition 12 and Maine's Question 3 animal welfare laws. These regulations, combined with ongoing inflationary pressures and seasonal demand patterns, will create significant upward price pressure in the US egg market.
