By scrutinizing city-by-city breakdowns and model-specific vulnerabilities, I discovered that London, Los Angeles, and Paris accounted for a disproportionate share of theft incidents, suggesting the need for heightened security measures in those regions. Additionally, the data indicated that certain battery models—particularly the B40S—were targeted more often, hinting at design or security gaps that merited a hardware-focused response. I recommended creating a centralized reporting and alert system to highlight sudden spikes in loss rates and streamline interventions across Lime’s global footprint.\n\n![](/images/Lime%20Battery%20Loss%20Analysis%20\\(2\\).png)\n\n**SQL Proficiency**\n\nTo complement the analytics portion, I produced a series of complex SQL queries designed to retrieve operational insights under varying conditions, such as how many batteries remained functional on specific days or whether certain carrier types faced higher rates of failure. By filtering and grouping the data around operational status, calendar dates, and region identifiers, I demonstrated how Lime could expose performance bottlenecks and rapidly identify areas requiring enhanced maintenance or resources. This segment underscored my ability to move seamlessly between high-level strategy and day-to-day data manipulation, providing leaders with actionable information supported by real-world metrics.![](/images/Lime%20Slide.png)\n**Standard Operating Procedure: Painting Scooters Gold**\n\nThe final component of the take-home task called for a standard operating procedure to paint a thousand scooters metallic gold in celebration of Lime’s 500-millionth ride. I drafted a structured process covering everything from ordering paint and equipment, to following branding guidelines, to overseeing post-deployment checks for consistent quality. By specifying roles, timelines, and steps for safety and uniformity, I aimed to ensure local market teams could adopt the initiative efficiently. This SOP highlighted how strong documentation practices and clear communication can facilitate high-visibility projects—even when executed across multiple regions and teams.![](/images/Solutions.png)\n"
