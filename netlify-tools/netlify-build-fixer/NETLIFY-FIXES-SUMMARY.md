# Netlify Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Issue**

   - Problem: Netlify CLI authentication was expired
   - Fix: Logged out and logged back in with `netlify logout` and `netlify login`

2. **Redirects File Missing in Build Directory**

   - Problem: \_redirects file was present in repository but missing in build output
   - Fix: Modified build command in netlify.toml to copy \_redirects file to build directory:
     ```toml
     command = "next build && cp _redirects .next/"
     ```

3. **Missing Functions Directory**
   - Problem: netlify.toml referenced a non-existent functions directory
   - Fix: Created the missing directory structure with `mkdir -p netlify/functions`

## Verification Steps

1. **Local Build Testing**

   - Ran `netlify build` to verify configuration locally
   - Resolved build-time issues

2. **Development Server Testing**

   - Started local development server with `netlify dev`
   - Verified site worked locally

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Successfully deployed to production with `netlify deploy --prod`
   - Verified site response with HTTP 200 status

## Deployment Status

- **Site URL**: https://nyreehinton.com
- **Admin URL**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/nyreehinton
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully deployed

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Lighthouse Warnings**

   - Local Lighthouse tests showed document request errors
   - This is expected in local testing and should resolve in production

2. **Algolia Plugin**
   - Plugin showed warnings during local builds
   - This is expected as the plugin only works during actual deployment

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Regular Builds**

   - Run `netlify build` locally before pushing changes
   - Watch for any new configuration issues

2. **Environment Variables**

   - Keep sensitive values in Netlify UI environment variables
   - Use .env for local development only

3. **Monitoring**
   - Regularly check deployment logs with `netlify logs:deploy`
   - Monitor function logs with `netlify logs:function`

## Diagnostic Tools Created

1. **check_deployment.py**
   - Simple script to verify deployment status
   - Checks site response and provides summary
   - Run with `python3 check_deployment.py`
